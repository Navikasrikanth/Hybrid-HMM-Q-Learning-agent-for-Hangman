# Hybrid-HMM-Q-Learning-agent-for-Hangman
This repository implements a hybrid Hangman agent that leverages a Bigram Hidden Markov Model to provide probabilistic letter suggestions and a Q-Learning agent to learn action policies via rewards. Includes training, evaluation, plots, and a Jupyter notebook demonstrating experiments and results.
